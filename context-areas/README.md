# Ecosystems and Projects

## Context Area Description

Ecosystem is used to describe the health status of open source community standing from ecology context. However, not all the open source communities or projects could be likened as an ecosystem, it should be able to be provided as a software platform (e.g., operating system, cloud infrastructure, or IDE).

We create three top level dimensions: Productivity, Robustness and Niche. Under each dimension,  we select metrics models from metrics-model-libs and categorize them by software artifact and social. The software artifacts aspect is about the tangible materials related to OSS projects including but not limited to source code, documents, binaries, etc. The social aspect is about the people involved in OSS projects, which focuses on the individuals, teams, organizations, their activities and interactions, social networks and communities, etc.

Hierarchy depth of metrics models depends on complexity of metrics and models.

```
Ecosystem
└───Productivity
│   |   Software Artifact
|   |   |   metrics models
|   |   Social
|   |   |   metrics models
└───Robustness
│   |   Software Artifact
|   |   |   metrics models
|   |   Social

└───Niche

```

## Dimensions



### **Productivity**
Definition: The efficiency with which an ecosystem or project converts inputs into output.

#### Software Artifact
* Code Quality Guarantee 
* Development Reponsiveness 

#### Social



### **Robustness**
Definition: The capability of an ecosystem or project to face and survive disruptions.

#### Software Artifact

#### Social
* [Community Activity](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-models/blob/main/metrics-model-libs/community-activity/definition/community-activity.md)
* [Project Engagement](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-models/blob/main/metrics-model-libs/project_engagement/definition/project_engagement.md)
* [Project Awareness](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-models/blob/main/metrics-model-libs/project-awareness/definition/project-awareness.md)
* [Funding](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-models/blob/main/metrics-model-libs/funding/definition/funding.md)
* Community Service and Support
* Community Welcomingness
* Project Influence


### **Niche**:
Definition: The capacity to create and recognize meaningful diversity and thereby new capabilities.

#### Software Artifact

#### Social
* [DEI Event Badging](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-metrics-models/blob/main/metrics-model-libs/dei-event-badging/definition/dei-event-badging.md)

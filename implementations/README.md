# Solution proposals


Hope to achieve the following goals：
- 1. Added “data-insight” , “algorithm”, “dataset” in  metric model repo.
- 2. In order to raise OSPOs and Community managers’ expectations on the value created by metrics model. We introduce community dataset.
- 3. It is the asset of CHAOSS in the future, with real community datasets: CHAOSS….
- 4. CHAOSS demo have data-insight, like data compare: A/B group comparison.

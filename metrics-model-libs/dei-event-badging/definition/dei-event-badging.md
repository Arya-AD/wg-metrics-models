# Why It Matters
As an event organizer, you would like to signal your attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion at your events. This metrics model is used to develop and recognize diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts within open source community conferences. This metrics model is publicly deployed and available at: CHAOSS DEI Event Badging Program.

# User Stories
- Event Organizers: It is important to create events that center diversity, equity, and inclusion in ways that are meaningful to all conference participants. 
- Event Attendees: It is important to understand how attentive an open source conference is to diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
- Event Sponsors: It is important to know that events your organization is sponsoring are attentive to issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

# Data Insights

## Background of the Investigated Context
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is an important consideration when planning an open source software event. The intention of the event badging program is to provide a common, peer reviewed DEI event badge. Currently the CHAOSS organization facilitates peer review for these badges. 

## Insights Drawn from the Metrics Model
Each event is reviewed following the DEI metrics noted above, and granted a badge that corresponds to the level of fulfillment available at the event. Some events may not be able to badge at the highest level, and that is ok because not all events can, for example, provide childcare.

## Metric Specific Insights Drawn from the Metrics Model
Through the badging review process, each metricâ€™s status for an event is evaluated, and over time insights about commonly unfulfilled items can be identified. 
Through the badging review process, event organizers can identify areas where DEI can be best centered and represented for event attendees. 
As a result of the badging review process, event attendees can best understand how the events that they attend address specific DEI-related issues.

# Funding

# Why It Matters
Funding has become an important part of open source projects. This can be in the form of the community itself receiving external financial support as well as developers being paid for their community work. Underfunded projects carry a potential to decline into an unusable state. With the current need to ensure the long-term viability of so many open source projects, funding can provide insights to the potential sustainability of an open source project.

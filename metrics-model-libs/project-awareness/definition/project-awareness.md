# Project Awareness

# Why It Matters
The project awareness model is about exploring how well known or popular a project is. Project awareness can be measured by how much activity is visible around a project. Although awareness and popularity is often viewed in a positive light, people may be aware of a project for a range of positive and negative reasons.
Project awareness may be used as a proxy for understanding project economic value because open source project economic value is hard to measure, due to a lack of available usage or financial information for open source projects. Similarly, project awareness may be used as a proxy for importance more generally. Awareness proxies for value and importance because it is related to the number of those who use or rely on the software, analogous to the way that brands are valued. Awareness may have a positive feedback loop in which more popular projects get more attention, attract more users or developers, and see ongoing increases in popularity [4,5,6].

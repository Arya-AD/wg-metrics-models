# Safety

# Why It Matters
The internet, and many digital spaces still reflect the preferences, bias and motivations of those who first had access to computers, and the internet; by those who had the most available time to explore their interests, whose gender roles were most supported (and thus successful) working in the fields of science and technology. 
Our challenge on behalf of inclusion, is to understand, evaluate and in many cases redesign systems of influence in digital spaces of which safety is at the very center. These metrics reflect foundations of how safe project spaces are established, improved and maintained.
 

# User Stories
Safety on the internet matters, but here are some specific scenarios where people might want to evaluate safety to have greater impact for inclusion and equity in open source.
I want to ensure that open source project spaces are safe:
As a company or non-profit and individual evaluating a project for funding or sponsorship.
As a contributor from a traditionally marginalized and equity-seeking group I want to evaluate whether or not a project is invested in my success at all levels of participation including leadership.
As a community manager/maintainer, I want to regularly challenge our project and community around safety and track our progress over time.
As an OSPO (or someone in charge of OS standards at a company/institution/org) I want to evaluate how well we are set up for inclusive governance.
Note that should evaluations determine that a project is determined not to be setup for success, this is not necessarily a reflection on that project's willingness, or capacity  - rather it’s a tool for learning and improving.  For example, if a funding company determines a project is not set up for equitable governance, they may opt to provide supplementary support as part of a grant to help that project improve.

# Metrics in the Metrics Model 
## [Psychological Safety](https://chaoss.community/metric-psychological-safety/)

A key component that is integral to the goal of community inclusion, is psychological safety. Psychological safety can be defined in several different stages, according to the Center for Creative Leadership:

Stage 1 – Inclusion Safety: Inclusion safety satisfies the basic human need to connect and belong. In this stage, you feel safe to be yourself and are accepted for who you are, including your unique attributes and defining characteristics.

Stage 2 – Learner Safety: Learner safety satisfies the need to learn and grow. In this stage, you feel safe to exchange in the learning process, by asking questions, giving and receiving feedback, experimenting, and making mistakes.

Stage 3 – Contributor Safety: Contributor safety satisfies the need to make a difference. You feel safe to use your skills and abilities to make a meaningful contribution.

Stage 4 – Challenger Safety: Challenger safety satisfies the need to make things better. You feel safe to speak up and challenge the status quo when you think there’s an opportunity to change or improve.

## [Inclusive Governance](https://chaoss.community/metric-code-of-conduct/)

We are moving away from talking about ‘Code of Conduct’ Enforcement as the central measurement for safe spaces, and rather towards the evaluation of governance setup in a way that traditionally marginalized and equity-seeking groups can trust. 
>  "looking at the root causes of harm, asking those questions about what it takes to make things equal, make things right, make things fair, it requires people to be vulnerable & people who have historically held power don't like doing that" 
-David Ryan Barcega Castro-Harris

|Description: There are currently four specific areas we look at for governance. The length of time it takes can be its own thing to reflect on.|
|Project Decision making documentation
|Source: Sean’s tool that shows sentiment ?|
```
Example (Minimum Viable Governance) 
Can you find it? 
Can you see how past decisions were made?
Example (Mozilla Governance Mailing List)
Does it show how community members are consulted in decisions?
Code of Conduct. 
Does it exist::
 Source:  (GitHub) Community Standards (github.com) 
 Is the Code of Conduct an accepted one by GitHub or GitLab?
 If custom, evaluate quality, Source: Metric Code of Conduct for Project - CHAOSS
Etiquette/Participation Guidelines
Are there additional listed ways of working inclusively in the context of the project and tools?
Example: OSPO-Courses/4-etiquette-guidelines.md at main · microsoft/OSPO-Courses (github.com)
Enforcement documentation quality
Can you find it?  Source: 
Does it include information on
How to raise a concern/report
The process (what to expect)
How decisions work
Who makes the decision
For open source projects owned/run by companies/orgs
Do they have HR, Security touchpoints(accountability) for reports that involve staff (reported, or being reported?
Enforcement evidence
Is there evidence in issues, discussion that violations are handled?

Ways to Measure: 
Do you understand how project decisions are made?
Do you know how to find past decisions?
Do you feel that you can contribute to the decision making process?
Did the existence of the code of conduct make you feel safer, and more empowered to fully participate in this project? 
Do you have any concerns about the enforcement process as documented?
Do you trust the code of conduct process?
If you reported a violation of the code of conduct, was it resolved to your satisfaction?

|Audience: Community Manager/Maintainer, Contributor|
|Description:  Metric Inclusive Leadership - CHAOSS  (using this same one)
 Leadership is central to a project/community's culture and how the leadership is determined requires intentional design and accountability for the inclusion and safety of others. Note the term leadership may vary depending on the project/community. Leadership roles have high visibility and the diversity of this group is critically important to fostering an inclusive community.|

```
Examples of leadership include:
Individuals serving as project maintainers (sometimes referred to as owners)
Individuals with repository merge access
Individuals who are organization members for the repository
Individuals who have defined community roles (community representatives, community speakers)
Individuals listed in project documents as contacts for issues with builds, documentation, or other community concerns
Individuals serving as community event organizers
Individuals serving as community mentors for available mentorship programs
```

|Source:  (taken from Metric Board Council Diversity - CHAOSS)|
|Observe whether open elections are held to see if candidates are representative of the member base. (Note: elections typically favor candidates of majorities and do not ensure that minorities are represented after the election)     Observe the diversity of board or council members from the project webpage (limitation: demographics are not always self-evident).   Ask the board for a report of the diversity of the board or council.|

|Audience: Community Manager/Maintainer, OSPO|
|Description: (description from Metric Project Burnout - CHAOSS) If a project maintainer (or generally the people who run the project) are at risk of, or are in burnout, this can significantly impact their ability to influence and ensure the safety of protected groups. It can also make those people more likely to endure that which would be unacceptable in a healthy, and safe environment.|

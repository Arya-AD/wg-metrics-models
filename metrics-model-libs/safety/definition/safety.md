# Why It Matters
The Internet, and many digital spaces still reflect the preferences, bias, and motivations of (1) those who first had access to computers, and the Internet, (2) those who had the most available time to explore their interests, and (3) whose gender roles were most supported (and thus successful) working in the fields of science and technology. Our challenge on behalf of inclusion, is to understand, evaluate, and in many cases redesign systems of influence in digital spaces of which safety is at the very center. This metrics model reflect foundations of how safe project spaces are established, improved, and maintained.

# User Stories
- As a company or non-profit and individual evaluating a project for funding or sponsorship.
- As a contributor from a traditionally marginalized and equity-seeking group I want to evaluate whether or not a project is invested in my success at all levels of participation including leadership.
- As a community manager/maintainer, I want to regularly challenge our project and community around safety and track our progress over time.
- As an OSPO (or someone in charge of OS standards at a company/institution/org) I want to evaluate how well we are set up for inclusive governance.

Note that should evaluations determine that a project is determined not to be set up for success, this is not necessarily a reflection on that project's willingness, or capacity  - rather it’s a tool for learning and improving.  For example, if a funding company determines a project is not set up for equitable governance, they may opt to provide supplementary support as part of a grant to help that project improve.

# Metrics in the Metrics Model 
### [Psychological Safety](https://chaoss.community/metric-psychological-safety/) 
A key component that is integral to the goal of community inclusion, is psychological safety. 

### [Project Code of Conduct](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-code-of-conduct-for-a-project/)   
The existence of a code of conduct signals the project’s awareness and concern for creating an equitable, diverse, and inclusive environment. The criteria outlined in a specific code of conduct clarifies for project members what is acceptable behavior, and potential consequences for unacceptable behavior. Finally, a code of conduct should provide well defined enforcement and reporting mechanisms for addressing violations of the code. The extent to which enforcement is easy to access, and consistently executed, the code of conduct is effective for ensuring a diverse, equitable, and inclusive project.

### [Event Code of Conduct](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-code-of-conduct-at-event/) 
A code of conduct describes rules of good behavior between event participants and what avenues are available when someone violates those expected good behaviors. An event with a code of conduct sends the signal that the organizers are willing to respond to incidents, which helps people from all backgrounds feel included and comfortable attending the event. Event participants are empowered to report incidences and proactively help mitigate situations of unwanted behavior.  

### [Inclusive Leadership](https://chaoss.community/metric-inclusive-leadership/) 
Leadership is central to a project/community's culture and how the leadership is determined requires intentional design and accountability for the inclusion of others. Note the term leadership may vary depending on the project/community. Leadership roles have high visibility and the diversity of this group is critically important to fostering an inclusive community.

### [Board/Council Diversity](https://chaoss.community/metric-board-council-diversity/) 
A governing board (or council - hereafter governing board) is a group of individuals who steer an open source project. Diversity in such groups is beneficial to signal that a project embraces diversity and that leadership roles are available to everyone. A diverse governing board also increases the chance that the issues raised by members of diverse backgrounds are heard and understood. Diversity can be represented in a variety of ways, including racial diversity, range of ability, age diversity, neurodiversity, geographical diversity, and others. Attention to intersectionality is also an important factor when assessing a governing board’s diversity.

### [Burnout](https://chaoss.community/metric-project-burnout/)
Burnout is a condition of mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion resulting from chronic stress. The three dimensions characterizing burnout are feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased cynicism or psychological distance from one’s work and reduced professional efficacy.
